Description: A collection of functions for symbolic computation using 'Ryacas'
  package for structural equation models. This package includes
  functions to calculate model-implied covariance (and correlation)
  matrix and sampling covariance matrix of functions of variables using
  the first-order Taylor approximation. Reference: McArdle and McDonald (1984) <doi:10.1111/j.2044-8317.1984.tb00802.x>.
